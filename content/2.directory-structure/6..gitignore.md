# Gitignore file

A `.gitignore` file specifies intentionally untracked files that git should ignore. Learn more about it in the [git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).

We recommend having a `.gitignore` file that has **at least** the following entries present:

```bash [.gitignore]
# Layer0 dev/build outputs
.layer0
dist
# Node dependencies
node_modules
# System files
*.log
```
