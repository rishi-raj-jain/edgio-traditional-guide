# Layer0 Configuration File

Layer0 can be easily configured with a single layer0.config file, which can have either a .js or .ts extension.

::code-group

```js [layer0.config.js]
// This file was automatically added by layer0 deploy.
// You should commit this file to source control.
module.exports = {
  // My Layer0 config
};
```

::

To ensure your configuration is up to date, Layer0 will make a full restart when detecting changes in the Layer0 main configuration file.
