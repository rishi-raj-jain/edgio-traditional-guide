# Source Directory

The src/ directory is where you put all your Layer0 components which can then be imported inside your `routes.js` file.

The directory contains the following files:

- [browser.ts](/directory-structure/src/browser): This is the entry point for the main.js javascript bundle which is added to the window.
- [cache.ts](/directory-structure/src/cache): This is where the caching rules are defined for both Layer0 (edge) and the browser.
- [routes.ts](/directory-structure/src/routes): This is where the routes to be cached and prefetched are defined, as well as what to pass through without modification and what to serve up as static content.
- [service-worker.ts](/directory-structure/src/service-worker): Is run on the browser. Is used to prefetch and serve content directly through browser.
- [shoppingFlowRouteHandler.ts](/directory-structure/src/shoppingFlowRouteHandler): Is run on Layer0 if referenced in `routes.ts`. Itâ€™s where the caching rules get implemented, as well as where the modifications to be made to the requests and/or responses to support caching of dynamic content are defined.
- [transform.ts](/directory-structure/src/transform): Is run on Layer0 Serverless, AWS Lambda. Is used to transform responses (and requests).
