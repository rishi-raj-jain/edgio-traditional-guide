# transform.ts
Is run on Layer0 Serverless, AWS Lambda. Is used to transform responses (and requests).

By default, this file is not referenced in the code.

:::alert{type="warning"}
Using this in production may (or most probably) result in 539, project timeouts. As this runs on AWS Lambda, if not cached, a high traffic might just touch the timeout limit.
:::

But in case you are just craving to try out this transform, here's you can enable it:

1. In `shoppingFlowRouteHandler.ts`, make the following changes:

::code-group
```diff [shoppingFlowRouteHandler.ts]
+ import transformResponse from './transform'

- proxy('origin')
+ proxy('origin', { transformResponse } )
```
::

2. Hit any matching route inside `routes.ts` that references to shoppingFlowRouteHandler, for e.g.:
::code-group
```ts [routes.ts]
  .match('/', shoppingFlowRouteHandler)
```
::

3. Load the matched route and see that it contains two more HTML tags inside the `<head>` tag:
::code-group 
```html [page.html]
  <script src="/__layer0__/cache-manifest.js" defer="defer"></script>
  <script src="/__layer0__/main.js" defer="defer"></script>
```
::

As you can see, the following code inside the tranform.ts adds those two tags:
::code-group
```ts [transform.ts]
  // Those 2 scripts are added using server side transformation just for Proof of Concept purposes.
  // For production these scripts should be included in original website base code.
  $('head').append(`
    <script src="/__layer0__/cache-manifest.js" defer="defer"></script>
    <script src="/__layer0__/main.js" defer="defer"></script>
  `)
```
::
