# Layer0 Directory

Layer0 uses the .layer0/ directory in development and production to generate your Layer0 application.

:::alert{type="warning"}
You should not touch any files inside since the whole directory will be re-created when running `layer0 dev`, `layer0 build` or `layer0 deploy`.
:::

This directory is interesting if you want to learn more about the files Layer0 generates based on your routing, to learn what all is served as static asset vs from the serverless.
