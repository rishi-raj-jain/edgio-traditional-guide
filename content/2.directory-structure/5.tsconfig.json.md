# TypeScript Configuration file

Layer0 Traditonal Template comes with a `tsconfig.json` file with the resolved aliases you are using in your Layer0 project, as well as with other sensible defaults. You can benefit from this by creating a tsconfig.json in the root of your project with the following content:

```js
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es5",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "declaration": true,
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "lib": ["dom"]
  },
  "include": ["src"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```
