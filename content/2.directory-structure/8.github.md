# GitHub Workflow Directory

:::alert{type="warning"}
In case you're going ahead with a github workflow method for your Layer0 deployments, do make sure that a environment secret of `layer0_deploy_token` is added to your GitHub repository. [Here's how you can add it](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository).
:::

The Layer0 traditional template comes with a `.github` workflow directory, in which there's `layer0.yml` configuration file.

```bash
| .github/
--| workflows/
----| layer0.yml
```

::code-group

```yml [.github/workflows/layer0.yml]
name: Deploy to Layer0

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:

jobs:
  deploy-to-layer0:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 14
          registry-url: https://npm-proxy.fury.io/moovweb/
      - run: npm i
      - run: npm run 0:deploy -- --token=$LAYER0_DEPLOY_TOKEN
        env:
          LAYER0_DEPLOY_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.LAYER0_DEPLOY_TOKEN }}
```

::

In all the yml file, when pushed on a git repository does the following:

- Spins up an Ubuntu instance
- Installs Node.js Version 14
- Executes `npm install` to install depedencies from package.json
- Execute `npm run 0:deploy` to build and deploy your app on Layer0.
