# Layer0 Traditional Site

## 1-Click Deploy

You can start by creating your own Layer0 traditional site and deploying to Layer0 by clicking the link:

<a target="_blank" href="https://app.layer0.co/deploy?repo=https://github.com/rishi-raj-jain/layer0-traditional-template"><img src="https://docs.layer0.co/button.svg" /></a>

Layer0 will create the traditional repository and deploy the site for you. Once done, every change in the repository will be deployed automatically.

## GitHub Template

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rishi-raj-jain/layer0-traditional-template
```

::code-group

```

```bash [npm]
